This is the repository for the paper **DiaHalu: A Dialogue-level Hallucination Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models**.
DiaHalu is a dialogue-level hallucination benchmark, consisting of both factuality and faithfulness hallucination, naturally generated by two ChatGPT3.5s or two GPT4s.
This benchmark covers four dialogue domains and five hallucination subtypes, extending from factuality and faithfulness hallucination.
